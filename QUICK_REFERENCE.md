# Quick Feature Summary

## 🎯 Three Major Enhancements Added

### ✅ Feature 1: DLC Edge Function Fitting

**What changed:**
- OLD: Generic polynomial fit (degree 5)
- NEW: Specialized DLC edge function with physical parameters

**The Formula:**
```
F = A[1 + Erf(2√(ln2)/f × (d-x))] + B×exp[-ln16/f² × (d-x)²] + C
```

**Why it matters:**
- Physically meaningful parameters
- Better fit for edge features
- Extracts beam spot size (FWHM)
- Identifies edge position precisely

**Example output:**
```
Fitted Parameters:
A (Erf amplitude) = 145.2341
B (Gaussian amplitude) = 67.8932
C (Baseline) = 23.4567
d (Edge position) = 25.7834
f (FWHM) = 3.2156
R² = 0.998734
```

### ✅ Feature 2: Multi-Selection Comparison

**What it does:**
Allows you to select multiple regions and compare them statistically

**Workflow:**
```
Select Area A → Shows "Selection 1 - Average counts: 234.5"
Select Area B → Shows "Selection 2 - Average counts: 198.3"
Select Area C → Shows "Selection 3 - Average counts: 256.1"
Close window → Displays comprehensive comparison
```

**Outputs:**
1. Bar chart of average counts
2. Statistics table (mean, std, min, max, size)
3. Distribution histograms overlaid
4. Console summary with all details

**Use case:**
"I need to compare signal intensity in 5 different regions of my sample"

---

### ✅ Feature 3: Row-wise Set Analysis

**What it does:**
Divides selected region into row sets and fits each separately

**Example:**
```
User selects: 100 rows × 50 columns
User inputs: 5 rows per set
Result: 20 sets created

Set 1: rows 0-5 → average → fit → plot
Set 2: rows 5-10 → average → fit → plot
...
Set 20: rows 95-100 → average → fit → plot

Final display: All 20 fits shown for comparison
```

**Outputs:**
1. Grid of individual plots (each set with its fit)
2. Overlay plot (all sets superimposed)
3. Parameter comparison chart (how A, B, C, d, f vary)

**Use case:**
"I want to see how the edge position changes across 100 scanning rows"

## 🚀 How to Use

### Simple 3-Step Process:

1. **Run script**
   ```bash
   python heatmap_selector_enhanced.py
   ```

2. **Choose mode**
   ```
   1. Single Selection (detailed DLC fit)
   2. Multi-Selection (compare regions)
   3. Row-wise Sets (track variation)
   4. Exit
   ```

3. **Select region(s) on heatmap**
   - Click and drag
   - Release to process
   - Results appear automatically

## 📊 Visual Comparison

### Mode 1: Single Selection
```
Before: Shows polynomial equation on plot
After:  Shows 5 physical parameters + R² + residuals
```

### Mode 2: Multi-Selection
```
Before: Only one selection at a time
After:  Unlimited selections + statistical comparison
```

### Mode 3: Row-wise Sets
```
Before: Not available
After:  Complete new feature for spatial variation analysis
```

## 🎓 When to Use Each Mode

| Mode | Best For | Time Required |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Precise edge characterization | 1 minute |
| 2 | Sample uniformity check | 2-5 minutes |
| 3 | Scanning direction analysis | 3-10 minutes |

---

## 💡 Key Advantages

1. **Physically Meaningful**: DLC formula relates to actual beam and sample properties
2. **Flexible**: Three modes for different analysis needs
3. **Comparative**: Easy to compare multiple regions or positions
4. **Visual**: Rich graphical outputs for publication/reports
5. **Backward Compatible**: Original functionality preserved in Mode 1

---

## 📝 Quick Tips

- Mode 1 = one region, best fit quality
- Mode 2 = many regions, statistical comparison
- Mode 3 = systematic variation along one direction

- Always check R² > 0.95 for reliable fits
- Use 5-10 rows per set in Mode 3 for stable results
- Select similar-sized regions in Mode 2 for fair comparison

## 🔧 What Stayed the Same

- File loading (Excel/CSV)
- Heatmap visualization
- Interactive selection (click and drag)
- Colormap options
- All original data handling

## 🆕 What's New

- DLC edge function fitting
- Multi-selection capability
- Row-wise set division
- Statistical comparison tools
- Parameter tracking across sets
- Residual analysis
